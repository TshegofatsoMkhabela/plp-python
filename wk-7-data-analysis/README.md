# Cereal Dataset Analysis ðŸ¥£

A comprehensive data analysis project that explores nutritional information and ratings of breakfast cereals using Python's data science stack.

## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a cereal dataset, examining relationships between nutritional content, manufacturer, and consumer ratings through statistical analysis and visualizations.

## Features

âœ… **Data Loading & Cleaning**: CSV import with error handling and missing value management  
âœ… **Exploratory Analysis**: Summary statistics and manufacturer insights  
âœ… **Data Visualization**: 4 different chart types showing key relationships  
âœ… **Statistical Insights**: Grouped analysis by manufacturer and cereal type

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

**Libraries Used:**

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` - Basic plotting and visualization
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization

## Dataset Requirements

The script expects a `cereal.csv` file in the same directory with the following columns:

- `mfr` - Manufacturer code (G, K, N, P, Q, R)
- `rating` - Consumer rating score
- `calories` - Calories per serving
- `sugars` - Sugar content
- `type` - Cereal type (Hot/Cold)

## Installation & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **Place dataset:**

   - Ensure `cereal.csv` is in the same directory as the script
   - Download from: [Kaggle Cereal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals)

3. **Run analysis:**
   ```bash
   python answers.py
   ```

Average rating by manufacturer:
mfr_full
Nabisco          68.402973
General Mills    34.485852
Kellogg's        29.509541
...
```

## Key Insights Discovered

### Manufacturer Analysis

- **Best Rated**: Nabisco cereals typically have highest average ratings
- **Market Leaders**: General Mills and Kellogg's dominate volume but vary in quality
- **Niche Players**: Smaller manufacturers often focus on specific market segments
